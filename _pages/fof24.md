### About the event
- **Date:** September 4 and 5, 2024
- **Local:** <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/DvN4WFp6hKDvHia36'>Center for Didactic Activities 3</a>, Campus Pampulha UFMG - Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais - Brazil

<hr>

### Objective
To bring together the thought leaders of the global football community to discuss and debate the future of sport, with a focus on the ways in which technology and data-driven decision-making can be leveraged to deepen fan engagement, build culture, lead to competitive advantages on-the-pitch, and create value for clubs’ communities—fans, players, leaders, sponsors, and owners.

### Background
The world is changing on many levels. Globalization of the sports business continues to reach new heights, with football leading the way. The pace of development of new data sources and analytical techniques is revolutionizing global football, both on and off the pitch. On the business and marketing side, global football is undergoing significant change. The attitudes and values of fans are evolving, presenting opportunities to create and expand the “culture” around our football clubs. New technologies are enabling deeper insights into fan behaviors and new techniques to intensify fan engagement are emerging. On the pitch, the proliferation of new and emerging data capture devices (wearables, doppler radar, optical and GPS tracking, hi-speed cameras, etc.), coupled with AI are having a dramatic impact.
In September 2022, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) debuted a conference dedicated to the technical data science aspects of football performance. The conference further expanded in September 2023, drawing nearly 300 attendees.

### The September 2024 version
Held on the campus of UFMG, is designed to expand the conference in two ways:
- By expanding the geographic reach to broader regions of Brazil and South America and beyond, drawing participants, panelists, thought leaders, and attendees from the global football world
- By adding a day focused on the business of football, to include sessions on fan engagement, revenue generation, the media landscape, sponsorships, and emerging streams and—topics for which all football clubs are seeking new learning
