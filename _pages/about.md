Welcome to the Sports Analytics Lab at the <a href='https://ufmg.br/'>Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)</a> - the first of its kind in Brazil! As a unique part of the <a href='https://dcc.ufmg.br/'>Computer Science Department</a>, our lab is composed of a dynamic, multidisciplinary team of faculty, PhD, MSc, and BS students, each bringing their own expertise and passion to the world of sports analytics.

Our dual mission is to conduct cutting-edge research and promote scientific divulgation, pushing the boundaries of knowledge in sports analytics. We strive to leverage data and advanced computational techniques to create meaningful insights, aiding in decision-making processes in the realm of sports. 

The lab is privileged to partner with <a href='https://www.pff.com/'>Pro Football Focus (PFF)</a>, a leading data provider in the field of sports analytics. This partnership empowers our research, giving us access to a vast pool of precise and comprehensive sports data. 

We are also proud of our pioneering role in Brazil's sports analytics landscape. In 2022, we organized the first-ever football analytics event in Brazil, "Football Analytics: Modelling and Experience (FAME)". The event was a groundbreaking endeavor, designed to bridge the gap between sports professionals, enthusiasts, and data scientists, promoting a dialogue between theory and practice.

In line with our commitment to education, we launched an innovative undergraduate course, "Data Science Applied to Football", in the first semester of 2023. The course serves as a platform to groom future sports analytics professionals, offering a comprehensive syllabus that merges theoretical knowledge with practical applications.

Thank you for visiting us! We invite you to explore our website, learn more about our initiatives, and join us in our journey to redefine the future of sports through data and analytics.
